					My name is Derek Murphy, I am a front end developer passionate about bridging
					compelling design with real world solutions. Whether it be visualizing data or
					creating an intuitive tool that makes everyday tasks a little bit easier, I aim
					to make technology work for people.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a software developer contracted for Schneider Electric, I helped to build a
					product configurator to help clients select and model complex energy management
					equipment. Before that I created an event map for Civic, a startup dedicated to
					connecting NYC nonprofits with the general public.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past Iâ€™ve worked a variety of roles, from a graphic designer at a pool
					toy company to a bartender and chef at a craft brewer. These experiences
					inspired me to find ways technology can help improve daily life and helped me
					develop a diverse skill set in design, communication, and problem-solving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of work, you can find me at the local hack night, or cycling around the
					city, exploring and photographing new neighborhoods.{" "}
